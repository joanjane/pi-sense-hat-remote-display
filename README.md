# PI Sense Hat Remote simulator
This project intends to simulate a LED matrix in a web environment for testing purposes when working on Rapsberry Pi Sense Hat projects.
It is a WIP and a pet project too :)

The idea is to create an abstraction over sense hat implementations and to build applications with the hability to swap the actual implementation of sense hat to this simulated one.
